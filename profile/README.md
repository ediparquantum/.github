# Welcome to Edinburgh and Paris Quantum Virtual Lab

The Edinburgh and Paris quantum virtual lab (EdiPar) explores and advances the state of art in quantum computing. EdiPar is based concurrently in the UK and France at the  

+ University of Edinburgh the school of [Quantum Informatics (qi)](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/quantum-informatics) and the
+ Sorbonne University and French National Center for Scientific Research [LIP6 - Quantum Information Team](https://qi.lip6.fr/)

We have collaborations with a number of academic and industrial parties.

+ [See our list of collaborators](https://www.ediparquantum.com/collaborations/collaborations/).

Main research areas fall broadly into $4$ main categories.

1. [Cloud computing](https://www.ediparquantum.com/research/cloud_computing/),
2. [Cyber security](https://www.ediparquantum.com/research/cyber_security/),
3. [Machine learning](https://www.ediparquantum.com/research/machine_learning/) and
4. [Verification](https://www.ediparquantum.com/research/verification/).

We publish regularly in these areas and submit initial articles to the [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/)

+ [EdiPar publications](https://www.ediparquantum.com/publications/publications/)
